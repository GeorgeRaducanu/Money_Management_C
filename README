A brief description of the implementation of the homework
The size_arr function returns the number of bytes of the *arr vector
The add_last function adds the data structure in the last position of the vector and actualises the length using the memcpy function
The add_at function inserts at the given index the data structure. The operation are done using basic operations with memory
The find function prints the data structures stored in the generic vector at the given index at it takes care of the different types
of dedications
The delete_at functions deletes the dedication at the given index so "Florin Copilu' de Biti" can sing uniterupted
The print function shows all dedications so "Florin Copilu' de Biti" can rest a little bit between dedications.
The verif_comm verifies the type of command selected
The main function brings all the other functions together as dedications bring people together.
It will use all of the previous function to solve the homework(by allocating and dealocating the data structure) and inserting the
dedication in the vector and performing the required operations.
In this way the program helps solve the required problems.
